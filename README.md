## 🚀 Project Overview

Briddhi is an **AI-powered urban management platform** designed to make cities smarter, safer, cleaner, and more citizen-friendly. The platform integrates **real-time traffic monitoring**, **infrastructure detection**, **smart waste management**, and **citizen engagement** into a single system.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Urban areas face numerous challenges:

* **Traffic Congestion & Accidents:** Leading to delays and safety concerns.
* **Infrastructure Monitoring Gaps:** Issues like potholes, broken streetlights, and weak bridges.
* **Inefficient Waste Management:** Overflowing bins and sanitation problems.
* **Limited Citizen Participation:** Lack of avenues for public feedback.
* **Reactive City Management:** Addressing problems after they occur instead of predicting them.

---

## 💡 Solution – Briddhi

Briddhi provides a unified platform for city authorities, citizens, and emergency services:

* **AI-driven Traffic Management:** Predicts congestion, suggests optimal routes, and alerts authorities.
* **Infrastructure Monitoring:** Detects potholes, broken streetlights, and weak bridges using computer vision.
* **Smart Waste Management:** Monitors bin levels and predicts optimal collection times.
* **Citizen Engagement:** Mobile/web app for issue reporting, tracking, and feedback.
* **Emergency Alerts:** Real-time notifications for accidents, floods, fires, or other hazards.
* **Sustainability & Planning:** Air quality monitoring, green zone suggestions, and future urban planning.

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React + Tailwind CSS
* **Backend:** Node.js + Express + MongoDB
* **AI/ML Services:** Python + FastAPI + PyTorch/TensorFlow
* **Realtime:** Socket.IO
* **Deployment:** Docker Compose / Cloud (Render, Vercel, or AWS)
